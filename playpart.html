    <h1>Sairakesh Gajavalli acts in a play</h1>
    <h3 class="green">The Master Builder Act 3 by Henrik Ibsen</h3>
    <p>MRS. SOLNESS, wrapped in a large white crepe shawl, sits resting in the arm-chair and gazes over to the right. Shortly after, HILDA WANGEL comes up the flight of steps from the garden.  She is dressed as in the last act, and wears her hat.  She has in her bodice a little nosegay of small common flowers.</p>
    <h4 class="char-name">MRS. SOLNESS</h4>
    <p class="red"> [Turning her head a little.]</p>
    <p>Have you been round the garden, Miss Wangel?</p>
    <h4 class="char-name">HILDA </h4>
    <p> Yes, I have been taking a look at it.</p>
    <h4 class="char-name">MRS. SOLNESS</h4>
    <p>And found some flowers too, I see.</p>
    <h4 class="char-name">HILDA</h4>
    <p>Yes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.</p>
    <h4 class="char-name">MRS. SOLNESS</h4>
    <p>Are there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.</p>
    <h4 class="char-name">HILDA</h4>
    <p class="red">[Closer.]</p>
    <p>What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day, then?</p>
    <h4 class="char-name">MRS. SOLNESS</h4>
    <p class="red">[With a faint smile.]</p>
    <p>I don't "run" anywhere, nowadays.</p>
    <h4 class="char-name">HILDA</h4>
    <p>Well, but do you not go down now and then to look at all the lovely things there?</p>
